# job_portal

In this project I am scrapping job links from web and showing analytics around it.

Features:
1.	Crawler
2.	Word match(spell check)
  i.	Create word bank from the website mentioned.
  ii.	Match the input word entered by the user to nearest word in dictionary using edit distance.
3.	Ranking sorting as per the output from the crawler. That how many jobs are available for that keyword.
